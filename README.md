🌍 TripAdvisor Clone – HTML & CSS Edition
This project is a front-end clone of the popular travel and review platform TripAdvisor, built entirely using HTML and CSS. It is designed to showcase my ability to structure content, style complex layouts, and recreate a visually appealing real-world website without relying on frameworks or JavaScript.

✨ Features
Beautiful Landing Page – A clean and organized homepage inspired by TripAdvisor’s travel theme.

Destination Highlights – Sections featuring hotels, restaurants, attractions, and must-visit places.

User-Friendly Layout – Well-structured design with clear sections and intuitive navigation.

Custom Styling – A carefully chosen color palette and fonts that reflect the brand’s travel-friendly vibe.

Attention to Detail – Pixel-perfect elements and spacing for a professional look.

📌 About This Project
The main goal of this project was to practice HTML and CSS fundamentals by recreating a real-world website interface. The focus was on semantic HTML for better structure and modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid for layout. While the design currently works best on desktop screens, future updates will include responsive design for mobile and tablet devices.

This project helped me improve in:

Writing clean and reusable CSS

Using Flexbox and Grid effectively

Organizing a large-scale webpage into modular sections

Paying attention to typography, colors, and spacing
